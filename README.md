## \_Kyoko teach you Date & Time Functions in 60 seconds\_


</div>

### Description

Learn *ALL* date & time functions in 60 seconds. I have seen a lot of beginner stuff here but none of them offer complete date & time functions (if has also complexxxxx!). One command button done all the functions in this project, so you will understand all those functions on the fly! I am always here to share with you what I have learnt, pls leave some comments! Thanks.
